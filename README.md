## Game Description:
We are building a FPS/Third Person survivial game based on the Hunger Games concept. It will have procederally generated levels, alongside multiplayer. The levels are generated with a Perlin noise, with borders around the map in a foggy atmosphere. The character is a white egg ... person ... thing that shoots a gun. You can set the amount of lives each player gets, and only one will stand alive.
